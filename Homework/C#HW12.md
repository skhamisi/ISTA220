## C# HW12

**1. How does inheritance promote the principle of donâ€™t repeat yourself (DRY)?**

* By only having to create common methods one time and reuse it multiple times

**2. What is the syntax of a derived class that inherits from a base class?**

* Class derivedclass : baseclass

**3. Do all user defined types (classes and structs) inherit from some base class? If so, what is it?**

* All classes derive from System.Object

**4. What happens if you do not have a default constructor in a base class when creating a derived class?**

* You have to call the correct base class constructor or you get a compile time error

**5. Can you assign a variable of a derived class to another variable of its base class? Why or why not?**

* Yes you can assign a derived class to a base class, because it is a form of the base class ( a horse is a mammal )

**6. Can you assign a variable of a derived class to another variable of of a derived class of its base class?
Why or why not?**

No, they are not the same types. Horses are not the same as whales

**7. Can you assign a variable of a base class to another variable of a derived class? Why or why not?**

* No, the derived class doesn't always have functionality that the base class has

**8. Under what circumstances would you want to use the new keyword when defining a method in a
derived class?**

* To hide a method in the base class method and turn the warning off

**9. What is a virtual method? Why would you want to define a virtual method?**

* A method that is intended to be overridden. It provides different implantations of the same method

**10. What does override do? Why does it do it?**

* It declares another implementation of that method

**11. How do you define an extension type?**

* In an extension method in a static class with a parameter of this keyword and the type
* Using the keyword 'this'.

**12. Why do you define an extension type?**

* To be able to call a function and immediately use it with your existing code.

**13. (Not in book) Explain the Liskov substitution principle.**

* Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming stating that, in a computer program, 
if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the 
desirable properties of the program.
